## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


When I was young, I couldn't stand red wine, perceiving it to be rancid juice. As I grew I was drawn to refine my palate, eventually gaining the ability to  rudimentary distinguish between "good" and "bad" wines. As a scientist, I am compelled to dig for a deeper understanding of red wine on a chemical level; what makes it good and bad.

The first step to exploring the data in wineQualityReds is importing the csv and any libraries I'll need.

```{r imports}
wf = read.csv("wineQualityReds.csv")
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(dplyr) #group_by(), mutate(), arrange()
```

Next, I want to look at the different variables in wf, or "winefile".

```{r}
names(wf)
head(wf)
```

Since this exploration will be trying to associate and quantify different chemical levels with "goodness". I will likely plot most variables against quality to find associations.

First, I will look at the range of quality of wines, as they were deemed by the sommeliers.
```{r}
summary(wf$quality)
```
```{r}
qplot(x = quality, data = wf, geom = "histogram", binwidth = .5,
      color = I("black"), fill = I("#900020")) + 
  scale_x_continuous(lim = c(1,10), breaks = seq(1,10,1))
```

The distribution is narrow, with a median of '6', with the lowest grade being '3', and highest '8'.

It is hopeful I will be able to draw conclusions of what chemical promotes (or demotes) a specific wine from the masses.

#First though, I will look at acidity: (not necessarily, may need change)
```{r histograms, echo=FALSE}
p1 <- qplot(x = fixed.acidity, data = wf, bins = 30, 
      color = I("black"), fill = I("#09DD99"))
p2 <- qplot(x = volatile.acidity, data = wf, bins = 30, 
      color = I("black"), fill = I("#09DD99"))
p3 <- qplot(x = citric.acid, data = wf, bins = 30, 
      color = I("black"), fill = I("#09DD99"))
p4 <- qplot(x = residual.sugar, data = wf, bins = 30, 
      color = I("black"), fill = I("#09DD99"))
p5 <- qplot(x = chlorides, data = wf, bins = 30, 
      color = I("black"), fill = I("#09DD99"))
p6 <- qplot(x = free.sulfur.dioxide, data = wf, bins = 30, 
      color = I("black"), fill = I("#09DD99"))
p7 <- qplot(x = total.sulfur.dioxide, data = wf, bins = 30, 
      color = I("black"), fill = I("#09DD99"))
p8 <- qplot(x = density, data = wf, bins = 30, 
      color = I("black"), fill = I("#09DD99"))
p9 <- qplot(x = pH, data = wf, bins = 30, 
      color = I("black"), fill = I("#09DD99"))
p10 <- qplot(x = sulphates, data = wf, bins = 30, 
      color = I("black"), fill = I("#09DD99"))
p11 <- qplot(x = alcohol, data = wf, bins = 30, 
      color = I("black"), fill = I("#09DD99"))
grid.arrange( p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8, p9, p10, p11, ncol=4)
```
```{r}
# summary(wf[, names(wf) != "density"])
summary(wf, digits = 3)
```

```{r}
qplot(data = wf, x = fixed.acidity, fill = fixed.acidity,geom = 'histogram') + 
  facet_wrap(~quality, scales = "fixed") +
  scale_x_continuous(lim = c(1,14), breaks = seq(1,14,1))
```
```{r}
summary(wf$pH)
```

```{r}
qplot(data = wf, x = volatile.acidity, fill = quality, geom = 'histogram') + 
  facet_wrap(~quality, scales = "free") +
  scale_x_continuous(lim = c(1,14), breaks = seq(1,14,1))

qplot(x = quality, y = pH, data = wf)


#correlation between fixed.acidity and pH, inverse as expected
ggplot(aes(x = fixed.acidity, y = pH), data = wf) + geom_point(alpha = 1/2, position = "jitter")
```
```{r}
quality_groups <- group_by(wf, quality)
quality_by_pH <- summarise(quality_groups,
          pH_mean = mean(pH),
          pH_median = median(pH),
          n = n() #only works for summarise
          )

#quality_by_pH <- arrange(quality_by_pH, -pH_mean) #how to order group by a variable
quality_by_pH

# another way to get this table
quality_by_pH <- wf %>%         # %.% chains functions onto the dataset
  group_by(quality) %>%
  summarise(pH_mean = mean(pH),
            pH_median = median(pH),
            n = n()) %>%
  arrange(quality)
wf.quality_by_pH
?'%>%'
```
```{r}
qualities <- split(wf,wf$quality)
lapply(qualities, function(x) {mean(x$pH)})
# or could do lapply(qualities, summary)
```
